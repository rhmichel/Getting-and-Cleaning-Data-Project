CodeBook for run_analysis.R


The "run_analysis.R" script follows the following steps:

1) It will load the zipped data files from the (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) link and put it in a directory named "HAR" (if required, it will create the directory). 
2) It unzips the zip file.
3) It reads the features and filters only the features that contain "mean()" and "std()".
4) It will load all train and test data for the filtered features. 
5) It will use negative widths in "read.fwf" to skip the columns that are not required. That makes it much faster to load and process.
6) It will merge the subject files to main data and then merges all train and test data (using rbind). The result is a dataframe named "all_data". 
7) It also labels the columns by the name of the features.
8) It creates another dataframe named "all_average" that contains the mean of all columns by "subject", using "aggregate" function.
9) It writes both dataframes into CSV files.
